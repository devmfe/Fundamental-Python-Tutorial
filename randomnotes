Python first complies your source code in to byte code.
Byte code runs faster than text statements in your python file
Byte code is stored in a file .pyc, if python has write access to your machine
In Python 3.2 and later byte code is stored in __pycache__ directory. File name aslo has the python version which created the byte code.
When you run the program second time, python directly loads the .pyc file and skip the compilation if:
Source code is not changed since the last compilation time
Python version is the same with which the byte code file was created.
